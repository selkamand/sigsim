Description: Tools for simulating mutation catalogues based on one or more mutational signatures, with or without added noise. 
  Supports both stochastic sampling (via multinomial models) and exact stratified sampling to mimic real-world or 
  controlled experimental conditions. Designed to aid benchmarking of signature 
  detection, sensitivity analysis, and overfitting assessment in mutational 
  signature analysis workflows.
